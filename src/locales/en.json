Live games require a moderator ( <span class='creator-color'>God</span> ) who does not participate as a player, and identities are assigned by application. At the start of the game, every mafioso is given the identities of their teammates, whereas citizens only receive the number of mafioso in the game, and do not know which players are mafia and which are citizens. <br /> There are two phases: <span class='night-color'>Night</span> and <span class='day-color'>Day</span>. At <span class='night-color'>Night</span>, certain players secretly perform special actions; during <span class='day-color'>Day</span>, players discuss and vote to kill one player, or eliminate, one player. These phases alternate with each other until all mafioso have been eliminated or until the mafia outnumbers the citizens. <br /> Some players may be given roles with special abilities (Chosen by <span class='creator-color'>Game Creator</span>) <br /><br /> <span class='night-color'>Night:</span> All players close their eyes. The moderator then instructs all members of <span class='mafia-role'>The Mafia</span> to open their eyes and acknowledge their accomplices. They will pick a victim by silently gesturing to indicate their target and to show unanimity then close their eyes again. A similar process occurs for other roles with nightly actions. <br /><br /> <span class='day-color'>Day:</span> The moderator instructs players to open their eyes and announces what happened the previous night. Discussion ensues among the living players. At any point, a player may accuse someone of being a mafioso and prompt others to vote to kill them. If over half of the players do so, the accused person is eliminated and <span class='night-color'>Night</span> begins. Otherwise, thos phase continues until a killing occurs. Dead players are not permitted to attempt to influence the remainder of the game. Because players have more freedom to deliberate, <span class='day-color'>Days</span> tend to be longer than <span class='night-color'>Nights</span>."
